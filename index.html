				<p><span class="important-text">The voice! </span>Chris Cornell (July 20, 1964) is an American rock musician and singer-songwriter, lead vocalist, primary songwriter and rhythm guitarist for Seattle rock band Soundgarden and as former lead vocalist and songwriter for the supergroup Audioslave. He is also known for his numerous solo works and soundtrack contributions since 1991, and as founder and frontman for Temple of the Dog, the one-off tribute band dedicated to his late friend Andrew Wood.
				Cornell is also known for his role as one of the architects of the 1990s grunge movement, he was voted "Rock's Greatest Singer" by readers of Guitar World, ranked 4th in the list of "Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists" by Hit Parader, 9th in the list of "Best Lead Singers of All Time" by Rolling Stone, and 12th in MTV's "22 Greatest Voices in Music".</p>

			<p><p><span class="important-text">The lead guitarist! </span>Kim A. Thayil (born September 4, 1960) is an American musician best known as the lead guitarist of the Seattle-based rock band Soundgarden, which he cofounded with singer Chris Cornell and bassist Hiro Yamamoto in 1984. Thayil was named the 100th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone.
			Thayil became acclaimed for his guitar work, which was typically characterized by heavy riffing, and was cited among other grunge guitarists as an influence and a pioneer of the "Seattle Sound." In 1994, Thayil commented, "I think Soundgarden is a pretty good band and I'm a fine guitarist. I'm not God, but I'm certainly not average. I feel very comfortable with the fact that not many other people can do what I do on guitar. I think my guitar is happy with the way I play it."

			<p><p><span class="important-text">The bassist! </span> Hunter Benedict "Ben" Shepherd (born September 20, 1968) is an American musician best known for playing bass in the rock band Soundgarden since 1990.
			Given Shepherd started playing bass trying to replace Hiro Yamamoto, he considers his Soundgarden predecessor a major influence, particularly as Yamamoto differed from bassists "relegated to a role of following along".
	  		Certain songs have Shepherd using a pick to provide "different textures". Shepherd considers that he approaches guitars "like a horn section", split between rhythm and lead, while "Bass is more fluid; you're a lot more free to do stuff because it's a song within a song". His preference is to play the bass along to the vocals, as "it helps to harmonize."</p>

			<p><p><span class="important-text">The drummer! </span>Matthew David "Matt" Cameron (born November 28, 1962) is an American musician who serves as the drummer for the American rock bands Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. After getting his start with the Seattle, Washington-based bands Bam Bam and Skin Yard, he first gained fame as the drummer for the band Soundgarden, which he joined in 1986 and remained in until the band's break-up in 1997, triggered by creative friction. In 1998, Cameron was invited to play on Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour. He soon became a permanent member and has remained in the band ever since. In 2010, Soundgarden reunited for new tour and released a new album, King Animal on November 13, 2012. </p>
